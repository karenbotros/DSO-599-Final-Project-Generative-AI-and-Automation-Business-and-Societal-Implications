**AI Use Case: Addressing Agricultural Deficiency After Disasters** 🌾🌪️

This repository houses the final project for our Generative AI and Automation: Business and Societal Implications class, 
which proposes an innovative solution to combat agricultural deficiencies caused by natural disasters. 
Our project report and slide deck detail a targeted app proposal, leveraging AI to help farmers prepare for and recover from extreme weather events.


🚜 **Why This Matters**

Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, wildfires, and droughts, result in catastrophic agricultural losses.


Hurricane Helene caused $40.3M–$162.2M in agricultural damages in Tampa Bay, highlighting the vulnerabilities in disaster-prone areas.
Global food security is at risk, with crop yields for staples like rice and maize projected to decline by 10–25% by 2050 due to climate shifts.
Traditional methods focus on damage control after disasters, often leaving farmers to bear the brunt of these crises. Our project explores how AI can shift the paradigm to proactive preparation and targeted recovery.

💡 **Proposed Solution**

We envision an AI-powered mobile application that:

Predicts extreme weather events using historical and real-time data.

Provides tailored recommendations for farmers at each stage of the crop cycle (e.g., early-stage transplants, mid-season adjustments).
Highlights second- and third-level impacts, such as soil depletion and ash fallout after wildfires, often overlooked by existing solutions.

Key Features:

Early Warning System: Alerts farmers to impending disasters.
Impact Visualization Maps: Enables farmers to assess localized risks.
Resource Allocation Guidance: Helps farmers optimize recovery resources.
Crop Substitution Advisor: AI-powered chatbot offering adaptive strategies for alternative crops based on disaster conditions.

📊 **Project Insights**

Data Strategy: Combines agricultural, weather, disaster, and satellite imaging data from reliable sources like the USDA, FEMA, and NASA.

Cost Analysis: Development estimated at $4.9M with projected annual savings of $504.2M, assuming a 5% adoption rate.

Market Potential: The global agri-tech market is projected to reach $49.2B by 2031, highlighting the scalability and impact of this solution.


🌍 **Impact**

Economic: Mitigates billions in annual losses and stabilizes agricultural supply chains.

Social: Improves food security and enhances farmers’ livelihoods.

Environmental: Promotes sustainable farming practices and reduces resource waste.
